AJAX with PHP and MySQL Repository

Description
This repository contains multiple folders, each demonstrating how to use AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) with PHP and MySQL for various databases and use cases. These examples showcase the seamless interaction between the client-side and server-side, allowing for dynamic and responsive web applications without the need for page reloads.

Each folder in this repository represents a different use case or database example. The structure is as follows:
•	Folder 1: [Database Name/Use Case]
o	index.html
